 Maybe this is a good time to talk about how I got into Programming, and iOS Programming to be specific.
 Since the second grade I was scripting in Html and Css working on simple websites for other kids in my
 class for around $10. Hosting them on free online servers I found with Google. When I bought my 
 MacBook, the first one. Xcode was one of the first downloads on my computer. I then spent an entire 
 summer learning Objective C and other languages because I wanted to be a "Software Engineer". At first
 it was difficult, but after a while I got the hang of it. I am primarily a user interface and 
 experience designer because I need everything to be perfect!!!
