/*

 This slide is to show my devotion to Apple Computers Inc. I do not touch Microsoft software or any of the 
 hardware MS uses to run their crappy OS on. Nobody could pay me to go back to Windows. Just thinking
 about Windows makes me shudder. And Windows 8? lmao pffft is that. #NotEverybodyHasATouchScreenThereGuys.
