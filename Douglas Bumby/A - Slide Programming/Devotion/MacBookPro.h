 Maybe I shouldn't of told you about my MacBook in the iPhone.h file, well... too late. I bought my first 
 MacBook with my own money and it was on a Friday after school. I can remember that I was telling literally 
 everybody. I walked into the Best Buy and I was so excited. The MacBook was on sale only $995 + tax. I 
 walked out of there with just pennies left in my pocket. I almost didn't have enough!! As we were walking 
 out of the store I felt so happy, so giddy that I was getting my first macintosh. Oh my. You have no idea.
 We got into the car, and I cracked the seal while sitting in the back. The crack of the plastic wrap just 
 makes my heart burst with happiness. I open the box and removed the soft cover of materal protecting the 
 delegate surface of the computer. My dad asks me "How is it?" I reply stuttering, "It's bea-bea-
 beautiful." I will never forget that day.
 
 Later that year around 9 months later. I started saving for my new MacBook. This time I was wanting to 
 purchase a MacBook Pro because it had a metal design which I craved. It took me around a year and a half 
 to save the $1700 to buy the new one. I was so satisfied with myself, that I could buy a new computer! I 
 hope to buy a new Retina MacBook Pro in the near future as well.
