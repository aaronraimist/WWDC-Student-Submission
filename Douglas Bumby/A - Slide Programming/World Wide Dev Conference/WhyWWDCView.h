/*
 
 I have been wanting to go to WWDC ever since I got my first iPhone. If I received the opportunity to go 
 to a WWDC event, I would first ask somebody to punch me in the face to see if I was dreaming. I would 
 do anything to go. :) I hope I receive the opportunity. :D You ask why I want to go to WWDC, eh? That's 
 pretty self explanatory. I've been wanting to come to this event for the longest time ever.
 I really hope I receive the chance to. :)
